#一次性抽取3个
You have a bag containing three A and two E scrabble letters. 
You consider the sample space of drawing three letters from the bag without replacing them. 
(i.e. each trial is dependent).
# List your sample space
samplespace <- c("AAE","AEA","EAA","AAA","AEE","EAE","EEA")

# The probability  that none of the outcomes in the sample will occur
0
# The probability that at least one of the outcomes in the sample space will occur
1

#有放回，抽取3次,每次抽取1个
#无放回，抽取3次,每次抽取1个

#独立相交事件，可以同时发生的两个独立事件，比如同时抛掷2枚骰子
Independent intersecting events：two events that do not influence each other and can occur similtaneously
P(A&B) = P(A)*P(B)

#互斥事件
Disjoint exhaustive events are mutually exclusive, so only one of the events can happen at a time.

#术语
The terminology includes "experiment", "trial", "event", "outcome", "random variable"

#条件概率
See how P(A|B)*P(B) is the same as P(B|A)*P(A)?

#Information about what type of plant something is can help tell us whether or not it lives outdoors.
This makes sense - any information you have about a plant will reduces the sample space of possible events that can occur.

#The formula for Bayes law is: P(A|B)=(P(B|A)∗P(A))/P(B)
Use this formula to solve the following problem: 
In a shop, people can take chewing gum from a dispenser on the right, or the left. 
The dispenser on the right has 7 packets of mint gum, and 3 packets of fruit gum, 
and the dispenser on the left has 7 packets of mint gum and 7 packets of fruit gum.

> # P(mint | right)
> mgr <- (7/10)
> 
> # P(right)
> # hint: Assume that people are indifferent
> # in their tendency to use either of the dispensers
> r <- 1/2
> 
> # P(mint)
> # hint: to calculate this probabilty, make use of a
> # decision tree where you first select for 'left' or
> # 'right' and subsequently for mint or fruit
> m <-(1/2)*(7/14)+(1/2)*(7/10)

> # Use components to solve P (right | mint)
