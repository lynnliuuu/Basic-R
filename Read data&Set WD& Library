#R contains many functions to read in data from different formats. To name only a few:

read.table: Reads in tabular data such as txt files
read.csv: Read in data from a comma-separated file format
readWorksheetFromFile : Reads in an excel worksheet
read.spss: Reads in data from .sav SPSS format.

# load in the data and store it in the variable cars
>cars <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/uva/mtcars.csv")
# print the first 6 rows of the dataset using the head() function
>head(cars)

#You can specify the separator in your read.csv function using the sep argument. 
By default, this argument for csv files is a comma. 
> cars <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/uva/mtcars_semicolon.csv",sep = ";")
> head(cars)

#知道你目前所处的工作目录
When reading in local files, it's good to have an idea what your working directory is. 
Your working directory is basically the part of your file system that R will look for files. 
Usually this is something along the lines of C:/Users/Username/documents. 
Of course this working directory is not static and can be changed by the user.

In R there are two important functions:
getwd(): This function will retrieve the current working directory for the user
setwd(): This functions allows the user to set her own working directory


#知道你目前工作目录里的所有文件
checking the files that exist in your current working directory. 
For instance, list.files() lists all the files that exists in your working directory.

#安装包、引用包
If we want to do so, we need to take 2 steps:
Install the package ggplot2 using： 
> install.packages("ggplot2")
Load the package ggplot2 using： 
> library(ggplot2) or > require(ggplot2)
