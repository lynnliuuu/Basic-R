NULL

When getting help on the mean function, you saw that it takes an argument x. 
X here is just an arbitrary name for the object that you want to find the mean of. Usually this object will be an R vector. We also saw the .... This is called an elipsis and is used to provide a number of optional arguments to the function.
Remember that R can match arguments both by position and by name. 

we want to find the mean of a vector called temperature. An example of matching by name is the following:
mean(x = temperature)
An example of matching by position is the following:
mean(temperature)

> # a grades vector
> grades <- c(8.5, 7, 9, 5.5, 6)
> 
> # calculate the mean of grades using matching by name
> mean(x=grades)
[1] 7.2
> 
> # calculate the mean of grades using matching by position
> mean(grades)
[1] 7.2


When we looked at the documentation of mean. 
The documentation showed us the following method:
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

> # a grades vector
> grades <- c(8.5, 7, 9, NA, 6)
> 
> mean(grades)
[1] NA
> 
> mean(x=grades,na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 7.625
